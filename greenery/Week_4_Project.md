Question 2: 
How are our users moving through the product funnel? Which steps in the funnel have largest drop off points?

The biggest drop off was from page views to add chart. 

Question 3A:
if your organization is using dbt, what are 1-2 things you might do differently / recommend to your organization based on learning from this course?

My data infrastructure team is working well with dbt and they are preparing some high level tables for the content team but I think we may have a capacity issue as there are only two people full time do this. After taking the course, I feel more prepared to embark on preparing my own schema for the Growth team with tables needed for AB Testing and start helping with the development of tests that can identify quality control issues.
